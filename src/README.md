# HW00: Tutorial
To get started with your homework assignments, follow the steps below.

## Set Up Your Virtual Environment
Before running any code, make sure you have your virtual environment set up.

- If you haven't set up a virtual environment yet, follow the setup instructions provided in the root repository.
- If you don't have `venv` like folder name and VSCode bash session does not show you `(venv)` on top, that means you need to setup a virtual environment

## Open VSCode in this directory
This `src` (source code) directory is where you are going to actually code. Open your VS Code here to proceed.

## Check Python Version
Make sure that Python is virtually executing and the correct version is available in your virtual environment.

Run the following command to check your Python virtual environment:
```bash
python --version
```

## Execution of Application
Once you check `python --version`, you can now run your application. Simply type in the following command.
```bash
./run.sh
```

## Do Homework
You are all set, all the steps for doing the HW is availble in `./hw00.py` file.
